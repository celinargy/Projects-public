# Personal projects
On this page you will find all my projects carried out either out of personal interest, or through my academic career.

# ðŸ“Š Projects using Python
### Real estate analysis
ðŸ”‘ Key Learnings (project in two parts)

- Data engineering: analysing, preparing and cleaning the data (potential outliers)
- Data analysis: perform exploratory descriptive analysis
- Data analysis: based on statistical methods, define the best listings for investment (payback period)

Part 2:
- Data science: using ML algorithms (CatBooster) to predict sale prices using historical data
- Data science: Calculate metrics to find out whether our ML model is ready for production
- Data analysis: perform statistical calculations (MSE and MAPE), exploratory data analysis
- Data engineering : Prepare datasets for machine learning algorithms

### Sentiment analysis
ðŸ”‘ Key Learnings

- Data collection : using selenium and chromedriver, web scrape customer reviews of several products
- Data engineering : gather, translate and tokenize reviews in order to perform sentiment analysis using transformer pipeline
- Data analysis : performing statistical analysis to define customer groups and interpret the data

### Supply chain problem
ðŸ”‘ Key Learnings

- Data engineering: standardize features, such as cost, to a single type of currency at a historical rate
- Data engineering : mill capacity and mill - delivery-point distance calculation using forward geocoding for data collection and using Haversine method for calculation
- Data analysis : assessing and forecasting performance of several mills under specific circumstances (such as sanctions)
- Data visualisation : using the abovementionned methods to plot datapoints and using scales to identify strong demand and/or trends
